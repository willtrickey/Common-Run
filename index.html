                <p>Common Run is designed to only store your data on your device, and only to provide the app's core features.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Data the app uses</h2>
                
                <h3>Workout routes</h3>
                <p>If you add a route by importing a file or sharing a workout, the route data is stored locally on your device. Routes are not stored anywhere else.</p>
                
                <h3>Location data</h3>
                <p>If you allow the app access to your live location, the app uses your live location to show your position on the map.</p>
                <p>Workout routes you share may include precise location coordinates. These coordinates are used only to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Display your route</li>
                    <li>Calculate and show elevation data</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Elevation calculation</h2>
                <p>To calculate elevation for a route, the route's coordinates are securely sent to a third-party elevation service (Open-Elevation) <strong>only</strong> to calculate elevation values.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coordinates are sent only once when the route is saved.</li>
                    <li>They are not used for advertising or tracking.</li>
                    <li>They are not intentionally retained beyond processing.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>We do not sell, or use your data for anything else</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>We do not sell your data</li>
                    <li>We do not use analytics or advertising SDKs</li>
                    <li>We do not track you across apps or websites</li>
                    <li>We do not collect background location data</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h2>Removing your data</h2>
                <p>To remove your data, you can delete routes or the app at any time.</p>
                <p>The app is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
